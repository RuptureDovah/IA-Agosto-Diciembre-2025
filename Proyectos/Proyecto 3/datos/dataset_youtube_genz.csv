https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xosRVxzjgA,"I'm a high schooler who goes to a school with an EBR (Evidence Based Reasoning) grading system.  For each test there is a scale for 1-4. 1 is developing, practically meaning you either didn't do the work or failed the test. A 2 is called approaching expectations, and it's anything from barely not failing to <90%. A 3 is called Meets Expectations. If you get a majority 3s in a standard or half in an increasing order (like 2-2-3-3) you can get a 3 for that standard. Every class has multiple standards. Some tests only count for one standard while others count for multiple. 4s do exist, and they're called Exceeding Expectations. You'd think it'd be worth it to get a 4, but it's only for your prude. In reality, they count for the exact same as a 3, but are a few times harder to get. Most of the time they require out of class understanding or skills that get taught later in class. For STEM classes, a 4 can only be achieved if you answer a level 4 question, which may not even be on a test. For all of semester 1 this year there has not been a level 4 question in my AP Calculus BC class or my AP Computer Science A class or my Principles of Engineering class.  For an example of how the system works, a calc test has 4 standards. Standards 1 & 2 are about actually solving the problem, standard 3 is about explanations, and standard 4 is about notation errors and the like. If you get a 3 for every standard, then you get an A. A single 2 for any standard is a B. Multiple 2s are a C. A single 1 in any standards is a D or F for the class.   For an English class however, the standards may work differently. In my AP Language and Composition course, there a 3 standards, with each test counting in only 1 standard due to their nature. Standard 1 deals with analyzing passages, and so only Rhetorical Analysis essays are placed there. Standard 2 is about participation, so discussion and reflection grades go here. Standard 3 is about writing, so all the argumentative essays and creative writing are lumped in there.   It's a complicated system unique to each class and is detrimental to the students taking it. It both makes it easy to scrape by if you're barely good enough at each standard and the teacher likes you. However, if the teacher doesn't like you, it's very easy to give you a 2 and block you from achieving an A. My school is very competitive and a B or less is sometimes a cause for teasing in friend groups and lowers your social standing. And don't get me started on parental pressure. Even if your parents stop pressuring you the pressure becomes self enforced.   A lot of other students I know cheat extensively on exams, from learning questions and answers for a math test or learning a prompt for an essay, or simply straight up lying to a teacher for an extension. A lot of people miss tests so they can take them later and have additional prep time. I don't know anyone who genuinely likes their classes and would go to them if they weren't required for college applications. Well, not technically required, but practically.  All of this basically ends up with students cheating, lying, working their butts off to get a grade that says that they simply met expectations. A grade that feels meaningless in a meaningless class. A majority of the people in my AP English class don't plan to go into a career anywhere near Language and Composition.   If you're curious, the school is Adlai E. Stevenson Highschool and the system is only in place because our principal gets money from it and from endorsing it. If your school is considering it, please either switch to another school or convince them not to. A longtime teacher left the school and published a report detailing all the issues with the system and why he left because of it.   TLDR: My school has a BS grading system that doesn't make sense and states that doing your all is simply ""meeting expectations"".",@scitimas12

I even used to be really ambitious and I still love what I'm doing, but the corporate environment needs to change completely, as it sucks the life out of people. What do we even need reviews for? Why do we need hours and hours of meetings? One year I got two reviews one saying ""needs to try harder in xyz"" the next one a few months later ""is doing too much on xyz"" That's when I stopped caring alltogether. On a different job I had full marks on all reviews, then I got laid off because they started hiring offshore and after having climbed a couple of steps because they wanted me to, I suddenly became too expensive for them. It's just not worth it. As much as I love doing my job, managers don't know what they are doing and keep criticising for no reason, just to pretend that they are working.

Now part of my issue is where I live, I'm in one of the worst states to work in and live in a pretty rural area, so I am at a huge disadvantage there, but still, the fact there has only been one job that I could apply to where I wouldn't have been auto denied or ran around in circles then denied is absolutely insane. I am also angry because I made the decision not to go to college with incomplete and inaccurate information about the impact that would have on my life, and now that decision has possibly screwed me for the rest of my life. I had been told that if I just work hard and go through entry level jobs and worked my way up the corporate ladder, that I would be fine, even without a college degree, which that turned out to be the biggest lie I've ever been told in my life, and that is saying something considering a lot of the understanding I had about how the world worked was just completely false, and I have only learned that in the past 3-4 years because of the reality check I have been getting from trying to find a job. I have tried talking to my boomer mother about this, but she is so disconnected from how things work now that I can't even have a productive conversation with her because every suggestion she makes is something I have either already tried or is so outdated I would get laughed out of any place I tried to apply too.

Mitch McConnell is Emperor Palpatine.   Some of you will die, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make! - Lord Trump  Trump is evil! He ignored this virus until he couldn't ignore it. The steps taken have been deliberately slow to contain this virus, as the government has been deliberately slow to contain this virus, as the government has made huge financial gains in allowing particularly older, retired people to die. No More pay outs each month.  Voting, if still valid, is our  only peaceful, legal recourse. Voting 3rd party is the ONLY WAY to get real humans in power, rather than dynasty families and career politicians. When we realize the 2 parties we are divided over LOVE the division among us. Then and only then may America be great again.   @Justin Y. Lack of knowledge of the Deep State? I just accused our government of mass murder. I understand Deep State. Fact that you refuse to listen, only attack, says too much about you. Clearly you haven't known hardship. Clearly none of this has impacted you negatively.  You are part of the problem,  offering zero solutions.  Calling me stupid really helps your case. Trump has very limited brain power, as evidenced by his rambling, generally repetitive,  Toddler Talks. Although most of us are solely undereducated, Trump really amazes me every time I listen to his banter.  Trump did not close the borders in time. Many flights brought sick folk here. Action wasn't taken until very late February and by then 15 confirmed cases were more than enough to allow airborne, lethal virus upon the world. This is dangerous because common behaviors,  such as shoulder to shoulder events, shopping and working conditions helped this virus along, even as people died in China daily, America went forward 2 full months without any concerns. Then, rather than force the hands of State Officials and put the population through a 2 month quarantine, we've been seeing States react, rather than prepare, all at the natural stages this virus thrives upon, complacency among enough of us to allow the spread to continue. You refusing to see this logic isn't a blight on my mental capacity, just proves you are as simple as our Lord Trump. Likely among those very few, who like many elites, don't care about the plight of the masses, whom I speak for, in this contrived crisis. Trump is calm about the virus because he exists outside the bounds of common folk. Trump and other powerful people would never have to take the risk of infection seriously as they are all well protected by expendable servants or can afford to continue living lavishly distanced from peons such as myself. 9/11 was an inside job and this proves what I've feared since, that the government can perform mass murder and the people will always accept it, hire the next sociopath in line, whichever of the 2 evil divisional parties they aspire to dwell in.   Our educational system is archaic. We could be educating everyone from home.  There are no valid excuses for our current broken schooling, no teachers need lose jobs as the internet is an amazing communication device.  Taxes are broken. Your dollar earned gets hit so many times yet we all accept that blindly.  Medicine is broken. My grandmother died because her selfish daughter needed cable TV more than grandma needed diabetes medicine. Millions suffer inability to afford insulin, despite initially starting out as a gift to humanity from a generous genius, privatized by Evil and Greed, priced beyond reality for most.  Our 2 party system is designed to keep us bickering. Division keeps us docile enough to accept our own government conspiring to murder us.  3rd party candidates are generally real humans, that care about other humans, even, gasp, total strangers and foreigners.  We are all on the same spaceship, Earth. I judge character, not race, not whatever religion folks are born into.   I am old...I am tired of seeing disasters get slow attention from government as poor people die due to delayed or nonexistent help.  It's about time the many take control, with votes, to dethrone the sociopaths that control us, play games with our very lives.   When there are only voluntarily homeless, when the janitor is paid living wage, when a high school graduate can earn enough in food service or retail to support a modest home and essentials while creating a nest egg...when Veterans are are given the same care as congress,  senate or other positions of power, rather than left to suffer and die, when the lowest paying jobs are enough to survive on, then and only then can Ameroca boast of being great.  As it stands, I feel most of us are born into lies we have no control over. It's well orchestrated, as my points are made clear in every satirical broadcast about the plight of the masses, world wide.  Do I want peace, equity and kumbaya? Yeah, I do. Are sociopaths in power oppressing the plebeians? Yeah, they are. Have good Democrats and Republicans existed? Yes...they get blocked by evil at every turn, often resigning due to unbeatable corruption. Do I pity the very people I label simple? You bet I do. I want this planet to be a better place for most, not some...for all, if ever possible.  This covid virus isn't done. It mutates too fast to pin down with a vaccine. We haven't seen the end of covid because we, as a planet, would have to agree on a few ground rules to consider being a functional society.  Most of us just exist and watch, lazily, rather than get directly involved in change. We don't seem to take note that we, the expendable masses, are being ordered to push through life ignoring this virus. It took ONE infection to start a Planet Wide Pandemic. Because we didn't quarantine from January through February, we get to watch innocent and otherwise lives lost daily.  Who are ""we"" in ""We're inthis together ""? Certainly not the elite who step on us to avoid harm. I'm furious with humanity as a whole. I'm furious we accept all this death and Trump's Toddler Talks, akin to a Ted Talk without useful insight.   Those of us suffering are many, while the privileged watch the show they created.   When...when will the common folk unite against tyranny, through the only peaceful means we have? Vote out career politicians and dynasty families in favor of real humans beings, with consciousness and compassion for the lowest among us? We won't stop the cycle of abuse by trading Democrats and Republicans, 2 sides of the same evil, corrupt coin. Let that coin land on edge...vote 3rd party, vote for real people with flaws, that understand what struggle is, that have put time behind any of these so-called essential, yet minimum wage jobs...  This economy is screwed...always has been. Vast majority of work available is menial labor, food service, retail, janitors, grocers. A great many take their wages in government,  which is far too big, complex and unsustainable.   Until any job can offer a modest, secure household, until the only homeless are those that volunteer to live ""free"", until the pill giants are mandated  to make life saving medicine reasonably priced,  we are a selfish, horrid nation, divided by the very people that oppress us, yet too busy fighting amongst ourselves to take any useful action towards a better tomorrow, for the  MANY, not the FEW!",@AstileaLavatica

If a college degree is really want you want, that is definitely possible. Just make sure you pick something that is both fulfilling and realistic when it comes to job opportunity and earnings such as engineering or nursing, which are both great fields that give you a very valuable degree in only four years of school, with the highest returns. Community college can be a great resource. You can do half of your school there for way cheaper and come out with the same degree. If college isn't what you're looking for then the trades are very lucrative right now depending on where you live. You can go to school for 2 years or less and come out with a better job than some college graduates. Don't lose hope. Trust me I was in the same position as you growing up when I was just entering high school dreaming about what I wanted to do in the world.

Parents won't let their kids have sleepovers anymore and unfortunately their reasoning is valid. Plus they're tracking you with your phone, so sneaking out is a no go. Every mistake you make has consequences. I actually think that Gen Z feels the pressures of what they're supposed to feel at age 20-30 in middle school and high school but with none of the experience or economic backing. We're asking 12 year olds to test into special high schools just to get a shot at a good career. And it turns out that career isn't going to pay you enough to live anyway, if you get a job at all. I don't think Gen Z has the economic standing to take risks without major consequences. Even if you do everything right, you can barely afford to live. You literally have to be born into a good life.",@SwordSnapper289

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qpPPM5NLNw,"Just throwing in my two cents as a 20-year-old Gen Z living in Australia (not the US).  I’ve got my licence, I’m juggling two jobs, and I’m currently studying at uni. On average, I work about 25 hours a week, split between data work at a hospital and shifts at Subway.  The reality is, I feel like I have to work this much just to have a shot at a decent future. Sure, I know people say you can take it slow—enjoy your 20s, then think about settling down in your late 20s or early 30s. But honestly, it feels like if I wait that long, I’ll either fall behind or just end up in the same rat race as everyone else my age.  Where I live, house prices are through the roof. Even saving up a 20% deposit could mean scraping together $60–80k for a 40-year-old place that needs renos. It’s disheartening knowing things have been gradually declining for decades, and from where we stand, they’re not looking like they’ll improve anytime soon.  We were brought up being told, “If you work hard, you’ll get there”—that one day we’d be able to afford a home. But look around—how many 25–35-year-olds (even people in their 40s) are still trying to break into the housing market? It’s getting worse, not better. And it makes you wonder… if things are only going to keep sliding downhill, what’s the point in trying so hard?  So many people in my generation have already resigned themselves to throwing away their dreams in exchange for short-term comfort. Constant access to dopamine through social media, internet addiction, not bothering with school or seeking meaningful work—it's not laziness, it's survival in a system that’s felt rigged from the beginning.  We’ve grown up under the pressure of impossible expectations while being handed fewer opportunities. We’re the product of a society that changed the rules, then told us we just weren’t trying hard enough.  I’d genuinely love to hear your thoughts on how you’d approach teaching or guiding my generation. What makes some people grind through the system, and others give up or tune out entirely? Is it upbringing, luck, resilience—or something deeper?",@eps1lon117

Not because Being an adult is the problem, it's the ability to stay afloat. I could drive, meet friends for bowling, watch friends, or whatever 20 yr olds 20 years ago did. But the problem is that trying to live that life now without prep is suicide. Getting a career as the economy shuts down EVEN HARDER than 2008 while bots moderate your resume, and the economy slowly prices working class people out of the market to preserve stockholder value, you feel like a caged animal where the only opening from the cage is entering into a hellscape.

It took 5 years to land my first good-paying job.  3 years after that, covid hit, and the cost of living surpassed my salary overnight, so all of the things I had been saving up for (like a house) immediately became unobtainable.

Honestly, I don't blame Gen-Z for being unmotivated.  I personally have to fight myself to do anything; I have no motivation at all.  It's not just that I have a fear of failure, it's that success has always been just out of reach for one reason or another no matter what I tried to do about it.  I'm tired of working so hard to stay so stuck.  No one should have to work so hard to fail.  And to add insult to injury, so many people blame me for the failures saying I should have chosen better.  Someone in my career field could have bought a modest home 30 years ago.  As far as I can tell, the only ""better"" choice I could have made in life was to be born 30 years earlier.  It's not really a great incentive to make success impossible to achieve and then blame the person struggling for not choosing a different impossible path.  And Gen-Z isn't stupid.

Fear was a big part of my responsible behavior when I was a child. Corporal punishment is a big and normal part of parenting in many Slavic cultures. I remember being in first grade, and being asked by our teacher to raise our hand if our parents don't use corporal punishment. Two children out of thirty raised their hand, and I know for a fact that one of those two  also got corporal punishment very occasionally, maybe 3 times in her life by the age of 6.  I was folding laundry because I would be spanked otherwise. I was helping with dishes because I would be beaten and ridiculed and made fun of otherwise.   And guess what? I have the same struggle with growing up as the other older gen Z has (born 1997), and I think it's because of two reasons.  1)  Having more responsibilities as a child didn't transform into having more freedoms. Also, I didn't really learn how to stand up for myself, because even though I was left to deal with my own problems, I could never stand up to my parents because I would be beaten if I did. 2) the economy is fucked, the only single people I know who don't live with 3 roommates are people who live in a countryside and work remote, precisely as a cheap labour for some big tech company.",@IHasLegs2

Going on jogs or walks with people on a trail or in a park. Instead of happy hours me and my friends would have ""healthy hours"" and go to the gym together in our apartment gyms that came free with rent. Instead of getting drinks, we'd get a latte or hot chocolate for a few dollars and window shop. Finding festivals in town to walk around in. Free concerts in the park. Having girls night in instead of going out. I live near natural rivers so we would go to the river on the weekends and bring some sandwiches and some beers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXxBpGhlAeY,"⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠ @Star_Rattler  That’s very interesting. I suppose always genuinely smiling at work almost necessarily has to be performative, as one cannot always be expected to be happy at a job.  I ended up writing a lot, more than I expected, so sorry in advance! I got the impression from reading that the act of smiling seems slightly difficult, or at least not easy, and it was the same for me in the past but no longer, and I wrote mostly about the progression in hopes that it could be useful or at least interesting to read about.  My mother mentioned to me years ago as a teenager that my neutral face could be very scary, and similarly to what you mentioned, I would have it even when happy. I’m not exactly sure how I came to my understanding of how facial muscles work, but I changed my neutral expression to be less scary and more… neutral. Muscles can be extended or contracted, and they lengthen or shorten based on their “training”. As in, the neutral position of a muscle is not absolute and unchanging. Take the tongue, for example. The optimal tongue posture has the tongue curved and touching the roof of the mouth, but some maladaptive postures have it flat and pushed against the teeth, which causes some facial development issues like stunting jaw development or splitting apart the two front teeth over time (I used to do this). After starting to move my tongue to the correct posture, though, eventually that’s where it rested neutrally as the muscles adjusted, and my tongue no longer ever tended to lie flat.   I write all this about the tongue because I believe the same applies to the muscles of the face. Partially, though, I was backtracking how I got to this point, as I assume learning from tongue posture back then helped with later changes. My neutral face had the muscles of my mouth almost fully extended, appearing to droop. What I changed was just… to not let them droop all the way, but actually hold them in the middle between fully smiling and fully drooping. Nowadays I look like I’m sliiiiiightly smiling. I think of this similarly to abdominal muscles, where the ideal is to slightly tense them and maintain better posture rather than allow your abs to sag completely.   Some muscles that are involved in truly smiling are involuntary, so there will always be some performative aspect to smiling if you’re not actually happy, but I do believe it’s possible to not have a scary or sad neutral face through just slightly changing posture and changing the natural resting state of muscles over time. I hope the read was at least somewhat interesting if not useful!",@cassusgames

I feel like a lot of gen z do the gen z stare not because they're awkward and don't know what to do, but because they're annoyed and they think they're above communication to stupid or weird people. They're sure fine socialising when it's time to go back to their peers and complain about the interaction.  They do this to neurodivergent people too so I don't feel any sympathy. For neurodivergents who are bad at communicating, these types of neurotypicals who just HATE communicating are the worst because they're the ones expecting you to get these minor cues and know unspoken rules and they get annoyed when you make a misguided effort to communicate which takes up their time  Sure, this convo will bring out underlying ableism in society, but I think at least the original videos were just calling out straight up antisocial behaviour and not awkward behaviour. Sitting there and gaping at someone with a flabbergasted, annoyed expression is rude. As sad as it is, most neurodivergent people would learn the hard way that this behaviour doesn't fly and we would have it drilled into us at a young age.

As you get older and get over yourself a bit more, and get your mind off the internet and become jaded like the rest of us. You'll find it's actually easier to simply be pleasant, even if it's not how you feel. Really only your parents and significant other care how you feel, and even for them. It's probably for the best to deal with your own problems and not dump them onto someone else as if we are not all human working through our own things. I am millennial, we were spoken of the same way you guys are now, just as you will speak of the generations which follow you. Your youth is fleeting and is almost never appreciated. Express gratitude for what you have, give when you can, and you will find fulfillment. My friends are mostly Gen x or gen Z with just a few other millennials. No, the customer is not always right, but the phrase doesn't exist because it's reality, it simply makes things move along like greasing the gears. Of course, none of us are paid enough to deal with problematic idiots, but you know what gets the problematic idiot out of the store faster than staring at them or starting a fight? Just nodding along with their b*******, giving them a pat on their stupid little head, and then sending them out the door with the product or service they came for.

What we remember is the long-term aftermath: the surveillance state, increased islamophobia, everything in the middle east, etc. The news about Abu Ghraib broke in 2004. We've never seen patriotism used for good, we've only seen it mask nationalism that is used for cruelty and exploitation. Sometimes this makes us cynical and apathetic, but I think it also helps us ignore national borders. Other than ironic feuds with the British and jokes about the Olympics, many of us have very little loyalty to an arbitrary national identity.

And whatever Trump may be, he’s a wrecking ball, and after seeing the cycle play out over and over, at least it’s catharsis to many.  Not saying they’re right…but i get it.  Reform hasn’t gotten us anywhere so f it?  But i digress…  They have been using the young left’s same emotional state and naïveté as they did with that anger and patriotism after 9/11.   I personally think they did it with pushing identity activism after they realized Occupy Wall Street was a potential threat to the actual ppl in power.  So they manipulated the Left to break their focus on bankers and law makers who caused the Recession and had us focus on ourselves based on race, sexuality, gender etc.  EVERYONE of those issues has been specifically inflamed since around 2012-14 and that’s right when Occupy dissolved.  It was VERY odd how big tech and banks supported BLM and Pride since they’d never supported any cause before, right? But it saved the bankers butts who gambled our savings, destroyed countless lives and then had the gov save them with our tax money cuz we weren’t looking at them anymore.  It’s like this mass focus on intersectionality appeared over night.  I’ve been aware of various cultural and political theory far longer than that, but it had never hit the mainstream until Occupy got too loud and too focused.  Also, notice the most DEI focused companies STILL have white guys as CEO’s lol.  Bob Iger??? wtf?  It’s all a game to them at the top.  They’ll gladly drop some white middle mgmt guy for the optics of appearing to care about social justice but their big fat ass isn’t moving out of the big chair, that’s for damn sure!  They do this kinda thing every time the news hammers a story of a white cop and Black victim.  They terrorize Black Americans into living in constant fear, they upset allies, causes a mass reaction and it’s all for one reason; to have “issues” for politicians to run on, and fear and anger to make people move with.  The reason id say with confidence i know its not authentic news is because in the last few years on avg you usually have around 700 or so white victims of cops, 200-300 Black victims and YES, when it comes to population size, that’s more Black victims per capita, but with zero white victims and so many unreported Black victims, how come we don’t know a single name or incident but the few Black victims they push hard as hell for?  The ones with white cops? Not ONE white guy out of thousands over the last 5 years was killed in an interesting enough way to make the news?  lol  And no, i’m not saying “poor white ppl”, i’m saying, it’s odd to leave out nearly a thousand deaths at police hands each year, except the ones most likely to cause racial division over the evil/dumb actions of a single cop here and there.  THAT is how u spot an agenda.  It’s not social justice, it’s social engineering.  And it’s causing more harm and division than any of the actual police incidents. And  those cops are murderers!     Not to mention, if everyone knew the real numbers, Black americans would very likely feel less persecuted, cause based on the “facts” given by the Times, MSNBC or w/e, and amplified by activists, you SHOULD feel like a deer in the woods with hunters all around! But that’s not reality.  People full of fear are the most malleable citizens though, because they are very very easy to move how you want them to, no matter if they’re geniuses or fools.  Fear is a powerful drug.  No matter what the media or activists tell you, never trust any issue with only two positions, cuz the piece of the puzzle they leave out is ALWAYS the part that has any value towards truth.    One more example….Regarding Abu Ghiraib…i was also shocked when i first learned of it.  But that’s ONE crappy little prison and atrocity is par for the course in war.  When i started to look into all the nations in active wars?  OMG Abu Ghiarab was like a party compared to watching gallons of blood drain from secret MP safe house in Tanzania.  Or seeing locals dig up fresh mass graves in a warehouse in Myanmar.  I can go on and on.  Humans with power, media and emotional well meaning citizens ready to march will always do evil things.    You need to be strong enough to know the ugly but remain skeptical and find context otherwise that’s exactly how you end up being the next torturer.   Powerful people have become godlike, tech and info is there weapon to wield, and all we can do is try not to jump when they tell us to.  Because it’s rarely the way you think it is, so i recommend watching and listening long before you decide to roll up your sleeves.   Just cuz someone points and say “that’s the bad guy!” doesn’t mean the guy pointing isn’t even worse!  Sorry to sound like a nihilist, but tbh i feel great empathy, it’s just that im a realist and i dont wanna jump for anyone but myself and the ppl i love.  Trust is great but it’ll make you into a monster if placed recklessly.  ❤️ 🇺🇸 🌍 🍆 😜",@Anti-Identity-Entity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlFCmHvWxlU,I had the exact opposite experience.  Why is this so hard to understand?  Locking in just means focusing on a goal you want to achieve. A goal that is yours that you want for a reason that’s not just because everyone else is doing it.    The alternative to locking in is to let life happen to you. Those are the two modes in life. Go with the flow or lock in.  Those are the two extremes. You can lock in for awhile and let life come as it goes for awhile. But if you never lock in about anything then you will never achieve anything outside of what life hands you.  It’s not even about hustling.  Making it through college takes locking in…finishing a boom takes locking in. Heck in this day and age watching a full movie without zoning out is locking in for some folks.  It’s literally just giving your attention to your goals.  😂😂,@DaughterofDiogenes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlFCmHvWxlU,"No it’s not…it’s about focusing on yourself and moving toward the goal you set for yourself.  It’s basic truth for life. If you want to get a thing you have to focus on getting it.  That’s what locking in is.   You lock your focus on the thing you want.  It is probably the only way the most of us will ever have the life you want.   It’s hard work and that’s because hard work is how you get good things.  I had to lock in to lose 60lbs and I am about as far from hustle culture as you can get.  Locking in just means focusing on yourself goal and move toward it a bit each day.   You can even fail but if you are locked in you get up and keep going.  I lost 30lbs and gained 20lbs back because I wasn’t taking it seriously.  .5 away from diabetes and my azz locked in and I got down 60lbs and changed my whole life to keep it off.  I want to be around to watch my kids grow up.  One thing that has always been true about young people is the preponderance of all or nothing thinking, a lack of nuance.    As he mentions locking in has always been around and is necessary.   It’s literally focusing on what you want to get it.  And he’s absolutely correct…if you don’t have a why that matters more to you than sitting around letting life happen to you then you will just continue to sit around and let life happen to you because that’s what our brains do.  They maintain the status quo.    In the US we let kids be kids (which means nothing is serious just sit there and be entertained, hello iPad kids).  So we raise children to not care about anything and think that somehow their brains will suddenly realize things later at a certain age.  Well that’s not how the brain works. If you teach kids nothing matters but entertainment you have a hoard of adults who don’t care about anything but entertainment.",@DaughterofDiogenes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlFCmHvWxlU,"It's my 2 year anniversary of being locked in, I think I got 3 more to go but honestly might just stay here. Word of advice to anyone that may be reading, don't try to give up distractions, just take control of what distracts yo u and allow yourself to be distracted occasionally. The grind feels badass, but if you never stop to allow yourself to be swept up by life, you'll reach the other of the two extremes and feel like you're not quite living. I'm not sure how to explain this, but it's so important, so I'll try; there's a certain ability which is very hard to gain conscious control over, it feels like uncoiling the spring on the minds clockwork, a very deliberate investment in allowing all your senses to feel. Honestly, it's also a type of focus; there comes a point where the focus on the grind becomes so distracting that all your channels of orientation within reality become dampened. When the quality of your reality suffers, you subconsciously lose some of your motivation to remain at your task within it. Enough focus to realize that you're human, with human limitations, and wind back the pendulum swing trying to view the opposite extreme as the easy fix. Changing one's mindset isn't enough, we have to be able to cultivate our reactions, perceptions, ideals; in order to find balance. Shifting just enough to not fall over. If you never focus to deliberately chill out, you'll never be able to really lock in.   Running at 50%, 85% of the time. Took a long time to get to that point. Even running at 40%, 60% of the time seems to be better than what most are doing; certainly better than running at 110%, 1% of the time (we all started there, it's miserable). You WILL need to be delusional if you're set on turning a want into a need; and that comes with its own downsides, the main one being that actual needs become neglected once you're willing to literally throw your life away in pursuit of a dream. Hold on the just enough realism to realize that dreams cannot be pursued by a dead man. In hindsight, it's crazy feeling like you're starving because you took some time to eat and stay healthy; but it's also one of the best feelings, because that's what purpose feels like. Don't let purpose kill you, don't let yourself die without it. Cheers.",@wheenishere

I guarantee you will have one goal come to mind doing this.   Most ppl don't do it bc it's boring and a lot of times painful bc you won't like what your inner voice is telling you.

Rockets will improve linearly for a time then reach some cap of our current understanding then stagnate.

They are being improved well enough that soon a home appliance will be able to make food, clothing, and home electronics. Amazon's drones will just deliver canisters of raw materials to your home.  It's hard to talk about comfort being used to control, right when all the other technologies are giving as much control as possible. The future isn't about being controlled, that's so 20th century.",@DonCDXX
